# RockPaperScissors

In this project, we will be recreating a simple implementation of a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The goal of this project is to reinforce familiarity with if/switch loops, various functions, and most importantly practicing good problem solving habits. In addition, we will also need to demonstrate proficiency with conditionals and operators.

# Revisited

We will now be adding a UI to this RPS game, such that a player will be able to play through the use of buttons alone, without the need to type their answer into a prompt. The goal of this project is to gain experience with DOM manipulation, Events, and Listeners. We should also demonstrate clean code during this project, and we might need Array methods as well.
