# RockPaperScissors

In this project, we will be recreating a simple implementation of a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The goal of this project is to reinforce familiarity with if/switch loops, various functions, and most importantly practicing good problem solving habits. In addition, we will also need to demonstrate proficiency with conditionals and operators.
